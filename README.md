## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, NodeJS, MongoDB

This application allows a user to add, delete, search, and browse through a collection of books. I created a collection 'Books' through MongoDb where all of the data is either added or found.


## Lessons Learned:

This project was the first full-stack application I ever made. There were so many new things to learn. In particular, connecting my database was frustrating. Using Node, Express and Mongodb was perplexing; however, now having finished this project, I can say I learned an incredible amount.
